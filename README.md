# Protein Ligand-Receptor Interactions
we integrated and verified 15 L-R interaction datasets from cell-cell communication-related databases and prediction algorithms, including CellChatDB, CellPhoneDB, CellTalkDB, IUPHAR/BPS, SingleCellSignalR, Ramilowski2015, connectomeDB2020, iTALK, scConnect, talklr, OmniPath, HPMR, ICELLNET and DLRP, scMLnet. The new version now includes over 7,400 human and 5,800 mouse protein L-R interactions, nearly doubling the previous version. Cellinker 2.0 is available at http://www.cellknowledge.com.cn/cellinker.
